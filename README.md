# ResponsiveWebDesign

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I have learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.  
First, I have build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 
Later, I have learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.  
Finally, I have learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, 
and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
